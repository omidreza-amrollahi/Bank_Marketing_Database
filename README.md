# Bank Marketing Database
This repository contains scripts and code for cleaning, processing, and storing marketing campaign data related to personal loans for a bank.

The initial dataset, a csv file named "bank_marketing.csv", needs to be processed to fit into a database schema consisting of three tables. The database is designed in PostgreSQL, and the data processing is handled using pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
